# GACHA
FOR THE FINAL WEEK OF SIEGE..

its a dumb gacha game..

This is good news..

THE THEME:
	
	This weeks theme was anything, so I really embraced it by making anything, where you can get anything

THE CREDITS:

	IKEA.

THE AI:

	no generative ai but a single image upscaled

THE MAKING / CODESPACES???

	SO this is obviously a kinda unserious game. Its ikea and you gacha with meatballs, its great
	This started off as a kinda joke, where I was wondering, what could I make this week??
	So i talk to my brother and he knows I play gacha games alot so I mean that could work
	then at school during robotics my friends brings up IKEA so thats what I go with so yea

	THE CODE is kinda funny. Cause its really really bad. Like dang I bruteforced alot of it with matches
	that look for every single outcome or a script for every single label thats like 10 lines each copy and pasted
	This made coding it really repetitve at times, but also really really fun. I just put on the bg music and go at it
	and it works great!! Ocrams razor or smth coming in clutch here cause most things I tried worked first try so thats
	AMAZING!!

	Anyways guys its been a good SIEGE, adioss
